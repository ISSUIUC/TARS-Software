 * @brief       The implementation of the finite state machine class that governs state transitions.
 *
 * The rocketFSM class encapsulates the finite state machine that dictates which state the rocket is in throughout the mission.
 * The class implements the logic necessary to reliably transition between states along with hysteresis to avoid premature state transitions.
 * 
 * This is a highly flight critical software module and should be tested throughly in simulation and on hardware targets.
