Created 3/3/2022

3/3/2022 Worked on making the command system more resilient - Added a command ID variable to the command and data structs. We will compare both to see if the IDs match. If they do, then we know the command was received. (Gautam, Patrick)

3/7/2022 Fixed the command queue. Frequency switching is problematic. (Gautam, Nick)
