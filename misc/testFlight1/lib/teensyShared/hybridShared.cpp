/** ptConversion
 * DESCRIPTION: Converts raw sensor data from hybrid engine pressure transducers into pressure in pascals.
 * NOTE: Does not currently do anything. Needs calibration data from pressure testing.
 * INPUTS: rawData - 13 bit data recieved from Teensy's ADC to convert into pressure.
 * RETURNS: pPascals - Floating point representation of pressure data in pascals.
